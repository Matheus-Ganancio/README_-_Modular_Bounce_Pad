Made without AI

This is an animated cushion-based bounce pad designed to launch your character with a satisfying spring effect. Everything is fully editable directly in the editorâ€”no coding needed. Customize size, direction, collision behavior and launch parameters via exposed variables and helper gizmos, just like shown in the demo.

Even if you want to customize further, the entire Blueprint logic is fully commented to make it easy to understandâ€”even if you're new to Unreal.

Customizable Settings (No Code Required)
Editor:

Impulse Strength: Adjust the launch power (e.g., Z +1000 or Z +1500).

Can Jump Through Cushion?: Toggle whether the player can jump through the platform from below or only land from above.

Spring End Points: Drag this small crystal-like gizmo in the viewport to change the springâ€™s height.

Cushion Scale X, Y, Z: Resize the visible cushion independently of the spring or physics.

Launch Direction: Orient the launch using the red arrow gizmo in the viewport.

ðŸ§© Key Features
Visual compression animation on the cushion when triggered, implemented in Blueprint.

Separate, modular components for spring, cushion, and launch logic.

Fully adjustable via editor variablesâ€”no Blueprint changes required for most tweaks.

Blueprint logic is commented and beginner-friendly.
